<h3>Born and raised in Minnesota, now located in Carson City, Nevada, Matthew Camelon lives with 
<br/> his wife and three children. Through his backyard shop Matt creates concrete sculpures 
and artwork <br/> specializing in foax boa effects.
Birdbaths, railings, yard decorations, and even fountains are just a few <br/> things that he has made through this concrete sculpting. 
</h3>
<br/>
<h3>
He began his work as an apprentice under master sculpter Matthew G. Welter at <a href="http://timelesssculptures.com/contents.php" style="color:#87AEE3">Timeless Sculpters</a>. 
After a few years, Matt <br/>left his work there and continued on his own starting with wood carving
and later transitioning into his present day concrete work.
